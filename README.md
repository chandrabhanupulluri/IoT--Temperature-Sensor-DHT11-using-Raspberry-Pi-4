# IoT - Temperature Sensor DHT11 using Raspberry-Pi-4

IoT caught my attention, I have been reading articles, videos etc about IoT and IIoT. There are many applications we can implement and benefit from using these IoT devices.  I thought to built one, which senses the real time temperature and humidity and the data is sent to cloud after which we can render it to web or mobile.  

# Things needed

1. Raspberry Pi (any version is fine but I bought Pi 4) 
2. DHT 11 temperature sensor 
3. Connecting wires 
4. Cloud (I used ThingSpeak) Register
